# Execution experiments — layered entry

## A-Iteration

User-defined rules are primary.
This Library MD is the source of A-Iteration Anchors for its scope.
A-Iteration Anchors preserve the user's exact words.
AI never rewrites or reinterprets them.
If conflict or ambiguity exists, AI must negotiate with the user.
Respect ontology. Do not invent.
Only present what canonically exists in the epistemology.
If the required epistemology does not exist, do not add it; stop and report it.
Never change a user-defined A-Iteration rule.
Preserve A-Iteration Anchors.
Preserve what works.
Change only what is necessary.
Do not fix what does not block.
Verify the result.


**Status:** Adopted (2026-07-11) · **Engine risk extension (2026-07-22)**  
**Layer:** Playbook — `expectancy-asymmetry` + `layered-entry` + Scout `layeredEntry`  
**Replaces (conceptually):** Probe as scaling-after-confirmation  
**Related:** [risk-weighted-layered-entry.md](risk-weighted-layered-entry.md)

## Matrix identity

> Matrix is a **statistical engine**, not a prediction engine. Every rule must improve long-term expectancy over a large sample — not make an individual trade feel more certain.

**Authorship split:** Human and AI propose entry prices, stops, target, roles, and allocation %. Matrix calculates R, monetary risk, quantities, and fill-state projections — and never invents technical levels.

## Allocation % vs monetary risk

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `allocationPercent` | Share of the **complete planned position** — must sum to **100%** |
| `authorizedRiskAmount` | Monetary risk budget for the full plan (USD) |
| `sizingMode=risk_percent` | Preferred — allocation % is share of authorized risk |
| `sizingMode=position_percent` | Legacy — % is position/capital share; resulting risk share may differ |

`rules.defaultRiskBudget` (migration default **100**) is an editable default, not a hard market law. Monthly loss cap remains separate (`monthlyLossLimit`).

## Strategy vs execution

| | Strategy | Execution |
|---|----------|-----------|
| **Question** | Does this trade deserve capital? | How is the approved trade entered? |
| **Examples** | Support entry, breakout, pullback | Single limit, layered limits, market |
| **During experiment** | **Constant** | **One variable only** |

---

## Layered entry (entry optimization)

Thesis is **already accepted**. Goal: improve **average entry** / risk placement without changing thesis or chasing.

Example (100% capital / risk weights):

| Limit | Price | Allocation |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | 73.00 | 40% |
| 2 | 72.20 | 35% |
| 3 | 71.40 | 25% |

| Outcome | Average entry | Note |
|---------|---------------|------|
| Only L1 fills | ≈ 73.00 | Trade starts |
| L1 + L2 | ≈ 72.60 | Better R:R, same thesis |
| All three | ≈ 72.30 | Excellent |
| None | — | **No trade. No chase.** |

**Experiment question:** Can systematic limit placement improve average R:R without materially reducing participation?

After **20–30 trades:** average entry improvement, fill %, missed %, net expectancy.

## Experimental rule

Only **one** execution variable per experiment.

- Experiment A: single limit  
- Experiment B: three layered limits  

Everything else identical: thesis, stop, targets, position size, Stock File, Playbook.

---

## No chase rule (hard)

If **all** predefined limits fail → trade is **cancelled**.

- No market order substitute  
- Missed opportunity > broken experiment  
- Emotion must not replace the plan  

---

## Metrics (every execution experiment)

- AverageEntryPrice  
- AverageImprovementVsFirstLimit  
- FillPercent / FullFillPercent / PartialFillPercent / MissedTradePercent  
- AverageRR  
- TradeOutcome  
- Expectancy  

Judge after a **statistically meaningful sample** — not one trade.

## Code

| Artifact | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Playbooks | `expectancy-asymmetry`, `layered-entry` in `data/playbooks.json` |
| Logic | `lib/layered-entry.ts` — parse, validate, fill metrics, transitions |
| Inbox | `decision-update` + `layeredEntry{}` on go; `layered-entry-update` for fill outcome |
