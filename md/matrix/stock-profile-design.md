# Stock Profile — design (suspect dossier)

## A-Iteration

User-defined rules are primary.
This Library MD is the source of A-Iteration Anchors for its scope.
A-Iteration Anchors preserve the user's exact words.
AI never rewrites or reinterprets them.
If conflict or ambiguity exists, AI must negotiate with the user.
Respect ontology. Do not invent.
Only present what canonically exists in the epistemology.
If the required epistemology does not exist, do not add it; stop and report it.
Never change a user-defined A-Iteration rule.
Preserve A-Iteration Anchors.
Preserve what works.
Change only what is necessary.
Do not fix what does not block.
Verify the result.


**Status:** Canonical design (2026-07-10).  
**Naming:** **Stock Profile** (user-facing). Code today: `StockThesis` / `stock-theses` — rename in UI first, ids later.

**Purpose:** Balanced, **light**, **append-friendly** dossier per ticker — any chat can patch values without rewriting history.

---

## Your requirements (restated)

1. **Do not overwrite** — filter, tune, trim over time; keep audit trail.
2. **Light to add** — stream evidence and corrections without schema explosion.
3. **Eventually without Cursor** — any chat reads mechanics, talks, proposes `file-update` / `evidence-add`; you Apply.
4. **Honest runtime** — know what saves today vs what is read-only fiction in UI.
5. **Steal good patterns** — not clone a journal; borrow dossier / memo / evidence-stream ideas.

## What saves TODAY (runtime truth)

Storage: `data/stock-theses.json` (JSON store; no Supabase table yet).

| Field / section | In JSON | Editable in UI | Editable via Inbox |
|-----------------|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| `id`, `ticker`, `style` | Yes | No (seed) | No |
| `thesis` (long thesis) | Yes | **Read-only** in UI | `file-update.thesis` overwrites field |
| `historicalAnalysis[]` | Yes | **Read-only** | No |
| `levels` (zones, targets) | Yes | **Read-only** | No |
| `riskRules` (min RR, invalidation) | Yes | **Read-only** | No |
| `currentHypothesis` | Yes | Yes (form) | `file-update` |
| `status` | Yes | Yes (form) | `file-update` |
| `notes` | Yes | Yes (form) | `file-update` appends stamped block |
| `version` | Auto +1 on save | — | — |
| Scout assessments | Appended into `notes` | — | `scout-assessment` |

**Gaps you sensed correctly:**

- Most of the dossier (levels, structure, analysis) is **fixture-only** — TSLA was seeded by dev, not by you.
- UI shows a “full file” but only **3 fields** save manually.
- No create-profile flow — only `ST-TSLA-001` exists.
- No evidence layer — thesis is **handwritten**, not derived.
- `notes` can grow messy (assessments append) — needs structured sections in V2.

## V2 Stock Profile — layered model (no overwrite)

Three layers on one ticker — **never merge into one blob**:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER A — Evidence stream (append)      │  ME-xxx rows, immutable
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER B — Synthesis snapshot (version)  │  hypothesis, confidence, zones
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER C — Annotations (append)          │  chat assessments, lessons
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Layer | Mutation rule |
|-------|---------------|
| A Evidence | Add only; supersede with pointer |
| B Synthesis | New version when batch of evidence applied; old version kept |
| C Annotations | Append only (today’s `notes` behavior) |

**You never edit Layer A.** You **propose** Layer B changes via inbox; you **trim** display in UI, not delete DB rows.

---

## Synthesis snapshot (light — max ~12 fields)

What any chat should see in one screen:

| Group | Fields |
|-------|--------|
| Identity | ticker, style, status, version |
| Confidence | thesisConfidence (0–100), lastUpdated |
| Story | oneLineThesis, currentHypothesis |
| Structure | majorSupport, majorResistance, primaryZone, secondaryZone |
| Targets | targets[] |
| Rules | minimumRR, invalidation |
| Pointers | activeEvidenceIds[] (last N) |

Long prose moves to **evidence** or **annotations** — not the snapshot core.

---

## Stolen patterns (what to borrow, not copy)

| Source | Steal | Do not steal |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **ARGUS** (same repo) | Evidence stream, append-only, entity dossier, export package | HR/org/project ontology |
| **Investment memo** (buy-side) | One-page summary + appendix; thesis vs catalyst vs risks | Word doc workflow |
| **Koyfin / research cards** | Ticker header + few KPIs + “what changed” | Live market data feed (V2 defer) |
| **TraderSync tags** | Dimensional tags on episodes | Broker sync |
| **Edgewonk** | Separate psychology from setup quality | Tiltmeter as product center |
| **Obsidian + frontmatter** | Structured header + free body | File-system as source of truth (app owns numbers) |
| **Clinical chart** | Chief complaint = hypothesis; vitals = evidence; plan = scout | Medical UI literally |

**Matrix unique combo:** Evidence stream (ARGUS-style) + Decision scout (not journal) + Inbox Apply (human gate) + monthly risk cap.

---

## Chat-friendly patch model (target)

Any chat should only propose **small patches**:

```json
{ "type": "evidence-add", "proposal": { "stockProfileId": "ST-TSLA-001", "category": "structure", "timeframe": "1W", "value": "HH/HL intact", "confidence": 72 } }
```

```json
{ "type": "file-update", "proposal": { "id": "ST-TSLA-001", "currentHypothesis": "...", "thesisConfidence": 78 } }
```

Never “rewrite entire profile JSON.”

---

## Trimming & tuning (without overwrite)

| Action | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Wrong evidence | `supersededBy` new evidence id |
| Stale hypothesis | new synthesis `version` |
| Noisy notes | UI collapse old annotations; archive section in export |
| Invalidated ticker | `status: invalidated` — profile frozen, scouts blocked |

---

## UI principle (when we code)

**One page, three tabs:**

1. **Snapshot** — synthesis (editable patches only)
2. **Evidence** — chronological stream + “Add evidence”
3. **History** — versions, assessments, scouts

No 15-field form on load. **Progressive disclosure.**

---

## Migration from today

| Today | V2 path |
|-------|---------|
| `StockThesis` type | `StockProfile` + `MarketEvidence[]` |
| `historicalAnalysis[]` | Migrate rows → Evidence (`category: structure`) |
| `notes` | Layer C annotations |
| Read-only sections | Become Layer B until evidence-add UI ships |

Existing `ST-TSLA-001` JSON remains valid — migration **adds** evidence rows, does not delete thesis text.
